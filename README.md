There are various measures of feasibility that helps to decide whether a particular project is
feasible
or not. These measures include –
1. Operational Feasibility
2. Technical Feasibility
3. Economical Feasibility
System Security
System security is a vital aspect when it comes to developing a system. The system should
ensure the facility Of preventing unauthorized personnel from accessing the information and
the data within the system. The system should provide total protection for each user’s
information so that the integrity of data is sustained and also prevent hackers from hacking
CHOICE OF PLATFORM
 Software Requirement
.NET Framework System Requirements
To ensure adequate performance, .NET Framework has the following minimum and
recommended system requirements for client and server applications
Methodology Adopted
Prototyping Model has been used for software development according to which a throwaway
prototype of the proposed system, based on the currently known requirements, is given to the
user so that he has a fair idea about how the proposed system is going to be like. This will
help him in deciding the interface, input and output requirements.
It can be easily adjudged that inputs and outputs are big in number, can increase
exponentially and may create a big chaos if not restricted properly. As the user spends some
time on the prototype, he will become more precise about his own inpu output Requirements.
This prototype will provide him with an environment analogous to the proposed system’s
environment.
Due to object oriented support in .NET, various concepts (like reusability,
polymorphism, isolation etc.) are already there but for the efficient management of system
components, Component based Software Engineering will also be exercised which will help
in a resultant library of components, the benefit of which will be reusability and fast
development.
Due to lack of hierarchical structure in object oriented approach, there is no meaning of
Bottom-up or Top-down testing. Testing will begin from the rudimentary levels of the system
and will move towards higher level components, which will be based on design phase rather
In the current system which is the semi computerized system the information may be lost in
the process of sending from one place to another. This is mainly due to human interaction in
the process of the transferring information from one place to another.
Whether the new system affects the current users in the system?
The new proposed system will affect the users in the following areas
● Accuracy
● Efficiency
● Productivity
● Robustness
● Lesser time consuming


Technical Feasibility
Based on the outline design of the system requirements in terms f inputs, output, Procedures,
the technical issues raised during technical feasibility include:
1. Does the necessary technology exist to do what is proposed?
Page | 262. Does the proposed equipment have the technical capacity to hold the data required to
use in the new system?
3. Adequate responses provided by the proposed system?
4. Is the system flexible enough to facilitate expansion?
5. Is there any technical guarantee of accuracy, reliability, ease of access and data
security?
The system developer’s task is to view needed capabilities in light of currently available
technology. Our site works hand in hand with high technology. A database has to be
maintained in order to update and backup data whenever required. To create databases we use
SQL server. After taking the above facts into consideration we can state that the new
proposed system is technically feasible.


Economical Feasibility
In making recommendations a study of the economics of the proposed system should be
made. Even though finding out the costs of the proposed project is difficult we assume and
estimate the costs and benefits as follows. According to the computerized system we propose,
the costs can be broken down in two categories.
1 Costs associated with the development of the system.
2 Costs associated with operating the system.
2.3.4 System Security
System security is a vital aspect when it comes to developing a system. The system should
Page | 27ensure the facility Of preventing unauthorized personnel from accessing the information and
the data within the system. The system should provide total protection for each user’s
information so that the integrity of data is sustained and also prevent hackers from hacking
the system.
The proposed system ensures the security and the integrity of data. This is done by providing
a password login system for each authorized users. And for example the System
Administrator has access to all kinds of information.
By providing this facility information is properly managed and information is protected. For
example the system administrator’s day to day tasks are lessened and easier because he
doesn’t have to have a constant eye on the system and worry about hackers hacking the
system.
